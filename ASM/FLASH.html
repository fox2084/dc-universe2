                <h1>BARRY ALLEN - THE FLASH</h1>
                <p> Thus far, at least four different characters—each of whom somehow gained the power of "the speed
                    force"—have assumed the mantle of the Flash in DC's history: college athlete Jay Garrick (1940–1951,
                    1961–2011, 2017–present), forensic scientist Barry Allen (1956–1985, 2008–present), Barry's nephew
                    Wally West (1986–2011, 2016–present), and Barry's grandson Bart Allen (2006–2007). Each incarnation
                    of the Flash has been a key member of at least one of DC's premier teams: the Justice Society of
                    America, the Justice League, and the Teen Titans. <br> <br>

                    The Flash is one of DC Comics' most popular characters and has been integral to the publisher's many
                    reality-changing "crisis" storylines over the years. The original meeting of the Golden Age Flash
                    Jay Garrick and Silver Age Flash Barry Allen in "Flash of Two Worlds" (1961) introduced the
                    Multiverse storytelling concept to DC readers, which would become the basis for many DC stories in
                    the years to come. </p>

            <div class="information">
                <h1>WALLACE RUDOLPH "WALLY" WEST - KID FLASH</h1>
                <p>The nephew of Iris West, he first appeared in Flash #110 (1959), which depicted his transformation
                    into Kid Flash. Under the mantle of Kid Flash, Wally was depicted as a teenage sidekick to his uncle
                    and a founding member of the Teen Titans. After Barry's death in Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1985,
                    Wally took on the role of the Flash from 1986 to 2009 in DC's main lineup until Barry returned in
                    The Flash: Rebirth. Even so, Wally is the fastest character to ever hold the mantle of the Flash and
                    a fan-favorite. He would later return as the main Flash since 2021, as part of the Infinite Frontier
                    relaunch. <br> <br>

                    In his debut as the Flash, Wally wears a distinct red and gold costume which, like his uncle, he
                    traditionally stores compressed inside a ring. He later creates a costume directly out of Speed
                    Force energy. Following his return in 2016, Wally is able to easily generate white lightning, which
                    means his connection to the speed force is stronger than ever. During the first stage of his return,
                    he temporarily wore an alternate red and silver costume when he wasn't the main Flash.</p>

                <h1>EOBARD THAWNE - REVERSE FLASH </h1>
                <p> Eobard Thawne, otherwise known as Professor Zoom and the Reverse-Flash, is a supervillain appearing
                    in comic books published by DC Comics. Created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino, he made his
                    debut in The Flash #139 (September 1963). The first and most well-known character to assume the
                    "Reverse-Flash" mantle, Thawne is the archenemy of Barry Allen (the second superhero to be called
                    the Flash), a descendant of Malcolm Thawne, and a forefather of Bart Allen, Thaddeus Thawne, and
                    Owen Mercer. He has been established as one of the fastest speedsters in the DC Universe. <br> <br>

                    Eobard Thawne has been voiced by C. Thomas Howell in the DC Animated Movie Universe and Liam O'Brien
                    in Injustice 2 while Tom Cavanagh and Matt Letscher have portrayed the character in various
                    television series set within The CW's live action Arrowverse, such as the 2014 television series The
                    Flash. Eobard Thawne found a time capsule in the 25th century containing a costume of the Flash
                    (Barry Allen) and with a Tachyon device amplified the suit's speed energy, giving himself speedster
                    abilities.</p>

                <h1>HUNTER ZOLOMON - ZOOM</h1>
                <p>Hunter Zolomon, otherwise known as Zoom, is a fictional supervillain appearing in comic books
                    published by DC Comics. The second character to assume the Reverse-Flash mantle, he serves as the
                    archenemy of Wally West (the third superhero to be called the Flash). After the DC Rebirth events,
                    Zolomon later serves as an adversary to West's mentor and predecessor Barry Allen. <br> <br>

                    Hunter came to the conclusion that Wally's refusal to help was because of never suffering a personal
                    tragedy unlike Barry Allen. Hunter became the supervillain "Zoom" (aka the second "Reverse-Flash")
                    to bring tragedy to Wally's life, believing that this was the only way to make the Flash a better
                    hero. During an attempt to kill the pregnant Linda Park, Zoom created an electrical shockwave that
                    caused Linda to miscarry their twins instead. Wally then forced Zoom into a temporal anomaly; Hunter
                    was rendered comatose and forced to relive his father-in-law's death repeatedly. </p>
