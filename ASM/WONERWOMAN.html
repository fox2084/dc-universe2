                <h1>DIANA PRINCE - WONDER WOMAN</h1>
                <p> Wonder Woman was created by the American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston (pen name:
                    Charles Moulton), and artist Harry G. Peter. Marston's wife, Elizabeth, and their life partner,
                    Olive Byrne, are credited as being his inspiration for the character's
                    appearance. Marston's comics featured his ideas on DISC theory, and the
                    character drew a great deal of inspiration from early feminists. <br> <br>

                    Wonder Woman's Bronze Age origin story relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother Queen
                    Hippolyta and was given a life as an Amazon, along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek
                    gods. In 2011, DC changed her background with the retcon that she is the biological daughter of Zeus
                    and Hippolyta, jointly raised by her mother and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe. The character has
                    changed in depiction over the decades, including briefly losing her powers entirely in the late
                    1960s; by the 1980s, artist George Perez gave her an athletic look and emphasized her Amazonian
                    heritage. She possesses an arsenal of magical items, including the Lasso of Truth, a pair of
                    indestructible bracelets, a tiara which serves as a projectile, and, in older stories, a range of
                    devices based on Amazon technology.</p>

            <div class="information">
                <h1>GOD OF OLYMPUS - ZEUS</h1>
                <p>Zeus is the ruler of Mount Olympus and the father of most of the Gods of Olympus, as well as Wonder
                    Woman. <br> <br>
                    Zeus was born the sixth son of Cronus and Rhea, and was the younger brother of Hades and Poseidon.
                    All of his siblings were eaten by Cronus due to him worrying one of them might overthrow him. So
                    when Zeus was born, his mother Rhea sought Gaia to devise a plan to save them and eventually get
                    retribution on Cronus on eating their children. Rhea secretly gave birth to Zeus, and handed Cronus
                    a stone wrapped in cloth thinking that was his son. Rhea took Zeus away and kept him hidden. <br>
                    <br>

                    When he grew to manhood, Zeus returned to face his father. They battled the Titans of Myth and
                    became the new ruler of Earth by slaying Cronus and forging a pact in the dead remains. Cronus was
                    then locked in Tartarus for the rest of eternity.</p>

                <h1>GOD OF WAR - ARES</h1>
                <p>Ares first appeared in Wonder Woman #1, published in the summer of 1942, written and created by
                    Wonder Woman creator William Moulton Marston. In the next issue, he reappeared under his Roman
                    name, Mars. He retained this name until February 1987, when comics writer/artist George Pérez
                    restored the Greek name Ares as part of his reboot of the Wonder Woman mythos. <br> <br>

                    As the narrative continuity of Wonder Woman comics has been adjusted by different writers and
                    artists throughout the years, various versions of Mars/Ares (with various personalities and physical
                    appearances) have been presented, though most have been depicted wearing Greek hoplite or Roman
                    gladiator armor. The character's longest-running look, designed by George Pérez, is that of a
                    red-eyed Greek warrior clad in black and indigo battle armor, face hidden by an Attic helmet. After
                    DC's continuity was rebooted in 2011 (an event known as The New 52), the character cycled through
                    several divergent visual interpretations (including one inspired by the physical appearance of
                    then-writer of Wonder Woman, Brian Azzarello) before returning to his Pérez-inspired warrior
                    design.</p>

                <h1>CASSANDRA SANDSMARK - SUPER GIRL</h1>
                <p>Cassie spent most of her time at her mother's place of work, the Gateway City Museum of Antiquities,
                    where she had a penchant for getting into trouble. She quickly befriended her mother's new employee,
                    Wonder Woman, and was eager to help her. During a fight with a Doomsday clone and another battle
                    with Decay, she created a costume and used magical acquirements (the Sandals of Hermes and the
                    Gauntlet of Atlas) to help Wonder Woman, much to her mother's horror. <br> <br> Cassie later had the
                    opportunity to ask Zeus for a boon, and requested real superpowers. Zeus granted her request, but
                    gave Dr. Sandsmark the ability to deactivate them. Dr. Sandsmark, however, reluctantly accepted her
                    daughter's wish to be a superheroine and rarely, if ever, used this ability. Artemis was assigned as
                    her teacher.</p>
