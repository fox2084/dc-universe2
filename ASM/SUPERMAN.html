                <h1>KAR-EL - CLARK KENT - SUPERMAN</h1>
                <p> Superman is a superhero who first appeared in American comic books published by DC Comics. The
                    character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, and debuted in the comic book
                    Action Comics #1 (cover-dated June 1938 and published April 18, 1938). Superman has been adapted
                    to a number of other media which includes radio serials, novels, movies, television shows and
                    theatre. <br> <br>

                    Superman was born on the planet Krypton and was given the name Kal-El at birth. As a baby, his
                    parents sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural
                    cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside, near the fictional town of Smallville. He
                    was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark developed
                    various superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His adoptive parents
                    advised him to use his abilities for the benefit of humanity, and he decided to fight crime. </p>

                <h1>KARA ZOL-EL - SUPERGIRL</h1>
                <p>Supergirl is the name of several fictional superheroines appearing in American comic books published
                    by DC Comics. The original and most well known Supergirl is Kara Zor-El, also known as the cousin of
                    the superhero Superman. The character made her first appearance in Action Comics #252 (May 1959) and
                    was created by Otto Binder and Al Plastino. <br> <br>
                    Created as a female counterpart to Superman, Kara Zor-El shares his super powers and vulnerability
                    to Kryptonite. Supergirl plays a supporting role in various DC Comics publications, including Action
                    Comics, Superman, and several comic book series unrelated to Superman. In 1969, Supergirl's
                    adventures became the lead feature in Adventure Comics, and she later starred in an eponymous comic
                    book series which debuted in 1972 and ran until 1974, followed by a second monthly comic book
                    series, The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl, which ran from 1982 to 1984. Supergirl was
                    originally introduced in Action Comics #252 as the cousin of the publisher's flagship superhero,
                    Superman in the story The Supergirl from Krypton. </p>

                <h1>JONATHAN "JON" KENT - SUPERBOY</h1>
                <p> Superboy is the name of several fictional superheroes appearing in American comicbooks published by
                    DC Comics. These characters have been featured in several eponymous comic series, in addition to
                    Adventure Comics and other series featuring teenage superhero groups. <br> <br>

                    From the character's first published story in 1944 until 1992, the title "Superboy" was applied to
                    versions of the adventures of Superman (Kal-El) as a boy, teenager or young adult. The primary
                    settings for the stories were the fictional town of Smallville, the 30th Century (where Superboy
                    featured in time travel adventures with the Legion of Super-Heroes) and universities attended by
                    Clark Kent. In 1993, a second Superboy was introduced, a young clone of Superman who was eventually
                    given both the name Kon-El and the secret identity of Conner Kent. In 2016, DC Comics introduced
                    another Superboy, Jonathan Kent, the son of the contemporary Superman and his wife Lois Lane.</p>

                <h1>KRYPTO THE SUPERDOG</h1>
                <p>Krypto the Superdog is an American children's animated television series produced by Warner Bros.
                    Animation, based on Superman's canine companion Krypto, which premiered on Cartoon Network on March
                    25, 2005, and aired on The CW's Saturday morning block Kids' WB from September 23, 2006 until
                    September 15, 2007. 39 episodes were produced. <br> <br>

                    A comic book series (based on the TV show) was published by DC Comics under the Johnny DC imprint,
                    which lasted 6 issues, from 2006 to 2007. <br> <br>

                    The show was developed by producers Alan Burnett and Paul Dini, who had produced the successful
                    Batman: The Animated Series and Superman: The Animated Series. Instead of continuing in that
                    style, Krypto was produced in a manner reminiscent of the Hanna-Barbera shows of the 1960s to the
                    1980s, from the sound effects down to the animation style (veteran Hanna-Barbera designer Iwao
                    Takamoto served as a creative consultant). </p>
