                    <h1>BRUCE WAYNE - BATMAN</h1>
                    <p> In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy,
                        philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City.
                        Batman's origin story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the
                        murder
                        of his parents Thomas and Martha;
                        he trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the
                        Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger,
                        and other creators accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekick Robin;
                        allies Alfred Pennyworth, James Gordon, and Catwoman;
                        and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker. <br> <br>
                        Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of DC's Superman; although
                        Kane
                        frequently claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a
                        generic
                        superhero into something more bat-like. The character received his own spin-off publication,
                        Batman,
                        in 1940. </p>

                    <h1>DICK GRAYSON - NIGHTWING</h1>
                    <p>Nightwing is a fictional character and superhero appearing in American comic books published by
                        DC
                        Comics. The character has appeared in various incarnations; the identity was adopted by Dick
                        Grayson
                        when he left his role as Batman's vigilante partner Robin. <br> <br>

                        Although Nightwing is commonly associated with Batman, the title and concept have origins in
                        classic
                        Superman stories. The original Nightwing in DC Comics was an identity assumed by alien superhero
                        Superman when stranded on the Kryptonian city of Kandor with his friend Jimmy Olsen. Drawing
                        inspiration from Batman and Robin, the two protect Kandor as the superheroes Nightwing and
                        Flamebird. Following the Crisis on Infinite Earths continuity reboot in 1985, Nightwing was
                        re-imagined as a legendary vigilante from Krypton whose story inspires Dick Grayson's choice of
                        name
                        when he leaves behind his Robin identity</p>

                    <h1>JASON TOOD - RED HOOD</h1>
                    <p> The Red Hood first appeared in Detective Comics #168 (February 1951), in the story "The Man
                        Behind
                        The Red Hood!". In this original continuity, he became the future Joker; a flashback reveals
                        that
                        a criminal, who at that time called himself the Red Hood after the (seemingly) eyeless red
                        dome-shaped hood worn by him, attempted to rob a playing card factory. While chased, he fell
                        into a
                        catch basin full of chemicals, which disfigured him, then escaped by swimming to safety (a
                        breathing
                        apparatus inside the hood preventing him from drowning). Driven insane by his change of
                        appearance,
                        he recreates himself as the Joker. A decade later, the Joker resumes the guise, while another
                        criminal attempts to adopt the identity, too. <br> <br>

                        In Batman: The Killing Joke, writer Alan Moore added the new detail that the future Joker, at
                        that
                        time a cash-strapped, unsuccessful comedian, had been made to adopt the Red Hood guise by a gang
                        of
                        criminals so that he could play the patsy for them. This story presented a darker version of the
                        origin and introduced the idea that the Joker acted as an unreliable narrator concerning his own
                        past.</p>

                    <h1>BARBARA GORDAN - BATGIRL</h1>
                    <p>Batgirl is the name of several fictional superheroines appearing in American comic books
                        published by
                        DC Comics, depicted as female counterparts to the superhero Batman. Although the character Betty
                        Kane was introduced into publication in 1961 by Bill Finger and Sheldon Moldoff as Bat-Girl, she
                        was
                        replaced by Barbara Gordon in 1967, who later came to be identified as the iconic Batgirl. The
                        character debuted in Detective Comics #359 (January 1967) by writer Gardner Fox and
                        artist Carmine Infantino, introduced as the daughter of police commissioner James Gordon. <br>
                        <br>

                        Batgirl operates in Gotham City, allying herself with Batman and the original Robin, Dick
                        Grayson,
                        along with other masked vigilantes. The character appeared regularly in Detective Comics, Batman
                        Family, and several other books produced by DC until 1988. That year, Barbara Gordon appeared in
                        Barbara Kesel's Batgirl Special #1, in which she retires from crime-fighting. She subsequently
                        appeared in Alan Moore's graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke where, in her civilian identity,
                        she
                        is shot by the Joker and left paraplegic. Although she is reimagined as the computer expert and
                        information broker Oracle by editor Kim Yale and writer John Ostrander the following year.</p>
